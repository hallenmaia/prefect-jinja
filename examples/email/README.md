# Send HTML emails

In this tutorial, we will create a flow to send welcome emails to users who have subscribed to a list.

As this repository can contain other email flows, a base model was created to standardize the main aspects.

In this tutorial we'll:

- Create a [base](#base) template to be used in all emails.
- Create a [welcome](#welcome) template to be sent to new users.
- Create a [flow](#flow) that sends a welcome email.
- Run `flow` and see its result.

!!! note "Sources"
    The sources for this tutorial can be found in the 
    [examples/email](https://github.com/hallenmaia/prefect-jinja/examples/email) folder of this repository.

## Getting Started

### Python setup

Requires an installation of Python 3.7+.

We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.

This flow is designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the 
[Prefect documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/).

!!! warning "prefect-email"
    This tutorial requires the [prefect-email](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-email/) collection to be installed 
    to send emails.

### Installation

Install `prefect-jinja` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install prefect-jinja
```

Install `prefect-email` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install prefect-email
```

Then, register to [view blocks](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/) on Prefect Cloud:

- [Jinja Environment](#jinja-environment):
```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_jinja.blocks
```
- [Email Server Credentials](#email-server-credentials):
```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_email.credentials
```


### Project Structure

Consider the following project structure:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ flows
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates
â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ welcome.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ send_welcome.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

Create the directories needed:

```bash
mkdir -p flows/templates 
```

### Blocks

Open the Prefect UI and navigate to the Blocks page.

To create a new block, select the **+** button on this page, or if you haven't previously created any blocks, 
**New Block**. Prefect displays a page of available block types.

For this example tutorial, we will use the **Jinja Environment** and **Email Server Credentials** blocks.

#### Jinja Environment

Scroll down the list of blocks and find the **Jinja Environment** block, then select **Add +** to configure a new block.

![Previewing the creation of the Jinja Environment block in the Prefect UI.](/prefect-jinja/img/tutorials/email/jinja_environment_block.png)

Enter the configuration for your templates:

- **Block Name** is the name by which your block is referenced. The name must only contain lowercase letters, numbers, 
and dashes.
- **Namespace** contains the variables that are available in every template loaded by the block.
- **Search Path** is the name of the directory where the templates are stored. Can be relative or absolute. Relative 
paths are relative to the current `flow` directory.

In this tutorial, we will use the following settings:

- **Block Name**: `email-templates`
- **Namespace**:
```json
{
    "logo": "https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/504beb80ec8dfc980a28612dd72249b413897927/8118e/assets/prefect-logo-gradient-navy.svg",
    "slack": "https://prefect.io/slack",
    "discourse": "https://discourse.prefect.io"
}
```
- **Search Path**: `templates`
 
Select **Create** to create the block. Prefect displays the details of the new block, including a code example for using 
the block within your flow code.

#### Email Server Credentials

Again, navigate to the Blocks page and select the **+** button on this page to create a new block. Scroll down the list 
of blocks and find the **Email Server Credentials** block, then select **Add +** to configure a new block.

Also create an `Email Server Credentials` block to store the access credentials to the outgoing email server.

![Previewing the creation of the Email Server Credentials block in the Prefect UI.](/prefect-jinja/img/tutorials/email/email_server_credentials_block.png)

Enter the configuration for your email server:

- **Block Name** is the name by which your block is referenced. The name must only contain lowercase letters, numbers, 
and dashes.
- **Username**: The username to use for authentication to the server.
- **Password**: The password to use for authentication to the server.
- **SMTP Server**: Either the hostname of the SMTP server, or one of the keys from the built-in SMTPServer Enum members, 
like "gmail".
- **SMTP Type**: Either "SSL", "STARTTLS", or "INSECURE".
- **SMPT Port**: If provided, overrides the smtp_type's default port number.

In this tutorial, we will use the following settings:

- **Block Name**: `outgoing-mail-server`

!!! warning "Username, Password and SMTP Server"
    The values of these fields were not displayed for security reasons. Check with your email provider for the correct
    values for these fields.

Select **Create** to create the block. Prefect displays the details of the new block, including a code example for using 
the block within your flow code.

### Templates

#### Base 

Create a file named `base.html` inside the `flows/templates` directory with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
<body>
<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td align="center">
            <img alt="Logo" src="{{ logo }}" width="200px" height="50px">
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            {% block content %}{% endblock %}
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Welcome

Create a file named `welcome.html` inside the `flows/templates` directory with the following content:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<p>Hi {{ username }}!</p>

```

### Flow

Create the `send_welcome.py` inside the `flows` directory with the following content:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_email import EmailServerCredentials, email_send_message
from prefect_jinja import JinjaEnvironmentBlock, jinja_render_from_template

@flow
def send_welcome_flow(username: str, email_to: str):
    jinja_environment = JinjaEnvironmentBlock.load("email-templates")
    email_body = jinja_render_from_template(
        "welcome.html", 
        jinja_environment, 
        username=username
    )
    
    email_server_credentials = EmailServerCredentials.load("outgoing-mail-server")
    email_send_message(
        email_server_credentials=email_server_credentials,
        subject="Welcome",
        msg=email_body,
        email_to=email_to,
    )

if __name__ == '__main__':
    result = send_welcome_flow(username="Jeronimo", email_to="jeronimo@example.com")
    print(result)
```

### Running

Enter the `flows` directory:

```bash
cd flows
```

Run `send_welcome.py` flows with python:

```bash
python send_welcome.py
```

That's it ðŸ¥³. The template will be rendered and sent to the user's email with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title></title>
<body>
<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td align="center">
            <img alt="Logo" src="" width="200px" height="50px">
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>Hi Jeronimo!</p>
